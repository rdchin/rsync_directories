# rsync_directories
Rsync two directories using menus (Dialog, Whiptail or text menus) to specify the directories.
Rsync has unidirectional synchronization only. Rsync from a source directory will duplicate it at the target directory.
After the synchronization is complete the target directory will be a duplicate of the source directory.
