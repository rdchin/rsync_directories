      #     serve almost everything.  Be aware that it does not include preserving ACLs (-A),  xattrs  (-X),
      #     atimes (-U), crtimes (-N), nor the finding and preserving of hardlinks (-H).
      #
      #     The  only exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case -r
      #     is not implied.
      #
      #--compress, -z
      #     With  this  option,  rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination maâ
      #     chine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted -- something  that  is  useful
      #     over a slow connection.
      #
      #     Rsync supports multiple compression methods and will choose one for you unless you force
      #     the choice using the --compress-choice (--zc) option.
      #
      #     Run rsync --version to see the default compress list compiled into your version.
      #
      #     When both sides of the transfer are at least 3.2.0, rsync chooses the first algorithm in
      #     the client's list of choices that is also in the server's list of choices.  If no common
      #     compress choice is found, rsync exits with an error.  If the remote rsync is too old  to
      #     support checksum negotiation, its list is assumed to be "zlib".
      #
      #     The  default  order  can  be  customized  by setting the environment variable RSYNC_COMâ
      #     PRESS_LIST to a space-separated list of acceptable compression  names.   If  the  string
      #     contains a "&" character, it is separated into the "client string & server string", othâ
      #     erwise the same string applies to both.  If the string (or string portion)  contains  no
      #     non-whitespace  characters,  the default compress list is used.  Any unknown compression
      #     names are discarded from the list, but a list with  only  invalid  names  results  in  a
      #     failed negotiation.
      #
      #     There  are  some older rsync versions that were configured to reject a -z option and reâ
      #     quire the use of -zz because their compression library was not compatible with  the  deâ
      #     fault  zlib  compression method.  You can usually ignore this weirdness unless the rsync
      #     server complains and tells you to specify -zz.
      #
      #     See also the --skip-compress option for the default list of file suffixes that  will  be
      #     transferred with no (or minimal) compression.
      #
      # --compress-choice=STR, --zc=STR
      #     This  option  can be used to override the automatic negotiation of the compression algoâ
      #     rithm that occurs when --compress is used.  The option implies --compress unless  "none"
      #     was specified, which instead implies --no-compress.
      #
      #     The compression options that you may be able to use are:
      #
      #     o      zstd
      #
      #     o      lz4
      #
      #     o      zlibx
      #
      #     o      zlib
      #
      #     o      none
      #
      #     Run  rsync --version  to see the default compress list compiled into your version (which
      #     may differ from the list above).
      #
      #     Note that if you see an error about an option named  --old-compress  or  --new-compress,
      #     this  is  rsync trying to send the --compress-choice=zlib or --compress-choice=zlibx opâ
      #     tion in a backward-compatible manner that more rsync versions  understand.   This  error
      #     indicates  that  the  older  rsync version on the server will not allow you to force the
      #     compression type.
      #
      # Note that the "zlibx" compression algorithm is just the "zlib"  algorithm  with  matched
      #     data excluded from the compression stream (to try to make it more compatible with an exâ
      #     ternal zlib implementation).
      #
      # --copy-links, -L
      #     When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to  (the  referent)  is  copied,
      #     rather  than the symlink.  In older versions of rsync, this option also had the side-efâ
      #     fect of telling the receiving side to follow symlinks, such as symlinks to  directories.
      #     In  a  modern rsync such as this one, you'll need to specify --keep-dirlinks (-K) to get
      #     this extra behavior.  The only exception is when sending files to an rsync that  is  too
      #     old  to  understand -K -- in that case, the -L option will still have the side-effect of
      #     -K on that older receiving rsync.
      #
      # --delete
      #     This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones that aren't on
      #     the  sending  side), but only for the directories that are being synchronized.  You must
      #     have asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. "dir"  or  "dir/")  without  using  a
      #     wildcard  for  the directory's contents (e.g. "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by
      #     the shell and rsync thus gets a request to transfer individual  files,  not  the  files'
      #     parent  directory.  Files that are excluded from the transfer are also excluded from beâ
      #     ing deleted unless you use the --delete-excluded option or mark the rules as only matchâ
      #     ing on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers in the FILTER RULES section).
      #
      #     Prior  to  rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless --recursive was enabled.
      #     Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will also occur when --dirs (-d) is  enabled,  but  only
      #     for directories whose contents are being copied.
      #
      #     This  option can be dangerous if used incorrectly! It is a very good idea to first try a
      #     run using the --dry-run option (-n) to see what files are going to be deleted.
      #
      #     If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files at the destiâ
      #     nation will be automatically disabled.  This is to prevent temporary filesystem failures
      #     (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from causing a massive deletion of files on the
      #     destination.  You can override this with the --ignore-errors option.
      #
      #     The  --delete  option may be combined with one of the --delete-WHEN options without conâ
      #     flict, as well as --delete-excluded.  However, if none of the --delete-WHEN options  are
      #     specified,  rsync  will choose the --delete-during algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0
      #     or newer, and the --delete-before algorithm when talking to an older  rsync.   See  also
      #     --delete-delay and --delete-after.
      #
      # --devices
      #     This option causes rsync to transfer character and block device files to the remote sysâ
      #     tem to recreate these devices.  This option has no effect if the receiving rsync is  not
      #     run as the super-user (see also the --super and --fake-super options).
      #
      # --specials
      #     This option causes rsync to transfer special files such as named sockets and fifos.
      #
      # -D  The -D option is equivalent to --devices --specials.
      #
      # --dry-run, -n
      #     This  makes rsync perform a trial run that doesn't make any changes (and produces mostly
      #     the same output as a real run).  It is most commonly used in combination with the --verâ
      #     bose,  -v  and/or --itemize-changes, -i options to see what an rsync command is going to
      #     do before one actually runs it.
      #
      #     The output of --itemize-changes is supposed to be exactly the same on a dry  run  and  a
      #     subsequent  real  run  (barring  intentional  trickery  and system call failures); if it
      #     isn't, that's a bug.  Other output should be mostly unchanged, but may  differ  in  some
      #     areas.   Notably,  a  dry  run  does  not  send  the  actual data for file transfers, so
      #     --progress has no effect, the  "bytes  sent",  "bytes  received",  "literal  data",  and
      #     "matched  data" statistics are too small, and the "speedup" value is equivalent to a run
      #     where no file transfers were needed.
      #
      # --exclude=PATTERN
      #     This option is a simplified form of the --filter option that defaults to an exclude rule
      #     and does not allow the full rule-parsing syntax of normal filter rules.
      #
      #     See the FILTER RULES section for detailed information on this option.
      #
      # --force
      #     This  option  tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it is to be replaced by a
      #     non-directory.  This is only relevant if deletions are not active (see --delete for  deâ
      #     tails).
      #
      #     Note for older rsync versions: --force used to still be required when using --delete-afâ
      #     ter, and it used to be non-functional unless the --recursive option was also enabled.
      #
      # --human-readable, -h
      #     Output numbers in a more human-readable format.  There are 3 possible levels: (1) output
      #     numbers with a separator between each set of 3 digits (either a comma or a  period,  deâ
      #     pending  on if the decimal point is represented by a period or a comma); (2) output numâ
      #     bers in units of 1000 (with a character suffix for larger units -- see below); (3)  outâ
      #     put numbers in units of 1024.
      #
      #     The  default is human-readable level 1.  Each -h option increases the level by one.  You
      #     can take the level down to 0 (to output numbers as pure digits) by specifying the  --no-
      #     human-readable (--no-h) option.
      #
      #     The  unit letters that are appended in levels 2 and 3 are: K (kilo), M (mega), G (giga),
      #     T (tera), or P (peta).  For example, a  1234567-byte  file  would  output  as  1.23M  in
      #     level-2 (assuming that a period is your local decimal point).
      #
      #     Backward compatibility note: versions of rsync prior to 3.1.0 do not support human-readâ
      #     able level 1, and they default to level 0.  Thus, specifying one or two -h options  will
      #     behave  in  a  comparable manner in old and new versions as long as you didn't specify a
      #     --no-h option prior to one or more -h options.  See the --list-only option for one  difâ
      #     ference.
      #
      # --itemize-changes, -i
      #     Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each file, includâ
      #     ing  attribute  changes.  This is exactly the same as specifying --out-format='%i %n%L'.
      #     If you repeat the option, unchanged files will also be output, but only if the receiving
      #     rsync  is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv with older versions of rsync, but that
      #     also turns on the output of other verbose messages).
      #
      #     The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long.   The  general  format  is
      #     like  the string YXcstpoguax, where Y is replaced by the type of update being done, X is
      #     replaced by the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may be output
      #     if they are being modified.
      #
      # --links, -l
      #     When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the destination.
      #
      # --log-file=FILE
      #     This option causes rsync to log what it is doing to a file.  This is similar to the logâ
      #     ging that a daemon does, but can be requested for the client side and/or the server side
      #     of a non-daemon transfer.  If specified as a client option, transfer logging will be enâ
      #     abled  with a default format of "%i %n%L".  See the --log-file-format option if you wish
      #     to override this.
      #
      #     Here's a example command that requests the remote side to log what is happening:
      #
      #         rsync -av --remote-option=--log-file=/tmp/rlog src/ dest/
      #
      #     This is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is closing unexpectedly.
      #
      # --progress
      #     This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer.  This
      #     gives a bored user something to watch.  With a modern rsync this is the same as specifyâ
      #     ing  --info=flist2,name,progress,  but  any  user-supplied settings for those info flags
      #     takes precedence (e.g.  "--info=flist0 --progress").
      #
      #     While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a progress line that  looks  like
      #     this:
      #
      #         782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04
      #
      #     In  this  example,  the  receiver  has reconstructed 782448 bytes or 63% of the sender's
      #     file, which is being reconstructed at a rate of 110.64 kilobytes  per  second,  and  the
      #     transfer will finish in 4 seconds if the current rate is maintained until the end.
      #
      #     These  statistics  can be misleading if rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is in use.  For
      #     example, if the sender's file consists of the basis file followed  by  additional  data,
      #     the  reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the receiver gets to the literal
      #     data, and the transfer will probably take much longer to finish than the receiver  estiâ
      #     mated as it was finishing the matched part of the file.
      #
      #     When  the  file  transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a summary line
      #     that looks like this:
      #
      #         1,238,099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfr#5, to-chk=169/396)
      #
      #     In this example, the file was 1,238,099 bytes long in total, the average rate of  transâ
      #     fer  for  the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes per second over the 8 seconds that it took
      #     to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file during the current rsync session,
      #     and there are 169 more files for the receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or
      #     not) remaining out of the 396 total files in the file-list.
      #
      #     In an incremental recursion scan, rsync won't know the total  number  of  files  in  the
      #     file-list  until  it reaches the ends of the scan, but since it starts to transfer files
      #     during the scan, it will display a line with the text "ir-chk" (for  incremental  recurâ
      #     sion check) instead of "to-chk" until the point that it knows the full size of the list,
      #     at which point it will switch to using "to-chk".  Thus, seeing "ir-chk"  lets  you  know
      #     that the total count of files in the file list is still going to increase (and each time
      #     it does, the count of files left to check will increase by the number of the files added
      #     to the list).
      #
      # --recursive, -r
      #     This tells rsync to copy directories recursively.  See also --dirs (-d).
      #
      #     Beginning with rsync 3.0.0, the recursive algorithm used is now an incremental  scan  that  uses
      #     much  less memory than before and begins the transfer after the scanning of the first few direcâ
      #     tories have been completed.  This incremental scan only affects  our  recursion  algorithm,  and
      #     does not change a non-recursive transfer.  It is also only possible when both ends of the transâ
      #     fer are at least version 3.0.0.
      #
      #     Some options require rsync to know the full file list, so these options disable the  incremental
      #     recursion  mode.   These include: --delete-before, --delete-after, --prune-empty-dirs, and --deâ
      #     lay-updates.  Because of this, the  default  delete  mode  when  you  specify  --delete  is  now
      #     --delete-during  when both ends of the connection are at least 3.0.0 (use --del or --delete-durâ
      #     ing to request this improved deletion mode explicitly).  See also the --delete-delay option that
      #     is a better choice than using --delete-after.
      #
      #     Incremental recursion can be disabled using the --no-inc-recursive option or its shorter --no-i-
      #     r alias.
      #
      # --size-only
      #     This  modifies  rsync's "quick check" algorithm for finding files that need to be transâ
      #     ferred, changing it from the default of transferring files with either a changed size or
      #     a  changed last-modified time to just looking for files that have changed in size.  This
      #     is useful when starting to use rsync after using another mirroring system which may  not
      #     preserve timestamps exactly.
      #
      # --times, -t
      #     This  tells rsync to transfer modification times along with the files and update them on
      #     the remote system.  Note that if this option is not used, the optimization that excludes
      #     files  that  have not been modified cannot be effective; in other words, a missing -t or
      #     -a will cause the next transfer to behave as if it used -I, causing all files to be  upâ
      #     dated  (though rsync's delta-transfer algorithm will make the update fairly efficient if
      #     the files haven't actually changed, you're much better off using -t).
      #
      # --perms, -p
      #     preserve permissions
      #
      # --group, -g
      #     preserve group
      #
      # --owner, -o
      #     preserve owner (super-user only)
      #
      # --verbose, -v
      #     This option increases the amount of information  the  daemon  logs  during  its  startup
      #     phase.   After  the  client connects, the daemon's verbosity level will be controlled by
      #     the options that the client used and the "max verbosity" setting in the module's  config
      #     section.
      #
      # -n, --dry-run
      #     This  makes rsync perform a trial run that doesnât make any changes (and produces mostly the same output
      #     as a real run).  It is most commonly used in combination with  the  -v,  --verbose  and/or  -i,  --itemâ
      #     ize-changes options to see what an rsync command is going to do before one actually runs it.
      #     The  output  of  --itemize-changes is supposed to be exactly the same on a dry run and a subsequent real
      #     run (barring intentional trickery and system call failures); if it isnât, thatâs a  bug.   Other  output
      #     should  be  mostly unchanged, but may differ in some areas.  Notably, a dry run does not send the actual
      #     data for file transfers, so --progress has no effect,  the  "bytes  sent",  "bytes  received",  "literal
      #     data", and "matched data" statistics are too small, and the "speedup" value is equivalent to a run where
      #     no file transfers were needed.
